# 1Writer Title Case

This [1Writer][1writer] action implements of John Gruber’s approach to [Title Case][titlecase] in Javascript.

To remove the 1Writer dependency, simple remove all code below the `// 1WRITER ACTION` line.

## Usage

To use as a 1Writer action, simply copy and paste the code as-is into the editor when creating a new Javascript action.

To use in your own code, pass the text you’d like to title case to `toTitleCase()` and it will return formatted text.
